mechanics
    ✓ energy - you need energy to function
    heat - each component generates heat, too much heat damages tools/armor and player
    insulation - protects you from low/high heat

environmental effects
    ✓ heat - based on height (space - extreme cold, hell - extreme heat)
    ✓ desert/beach = high temperature
    medium rock layer - dangerous gases
    jungle - poisonous atmosphere
    ✓ ice biome - low temperatures
    underground ice biome - very low temperatures
    water - electrocution

PRE-HM

armor platings
    4 - 25

    gold - medium heat dissapation 12, very low defense 3
    aluminium - medium heat dissapation 12, medium defense 4
    steel - low heat dissapation 11, very high defense 6
    tungsten carbide - medium heat dissapation 13, extremely high defense 8
    diamond doped tungsten carbine - very high heat dissapation 18, extremely high defense 9

insulation
    insulation protects against cold, prevents heat from escaping

skin -> air -> clothes -> air -> armor -> air

player = 1.9 m^2
player = 4.7 W/m2*K (3 W with clothes)
player = 80 * 3500 J/K
player = up to 120W heat gen

k = h * A / C
	k [1/s] is the cooling coefficient,
	h [W/(m² * K)] is the heat transfer coefficient,
	A [m²] is the area of the heat exchange,
	C [J/K] is the heat capacity.

T = T_ambient + (T_initial - T_ambient) * exp(- k * t) + (120*t) / (80 * 3500)
	T [K] is the temperature of the object at the time t,
	T_ambient [K] is the ambient temperature,
	T_initial [K] is the initial temperature of the object,
	k [1/s] is the cooling coefficient,
	t [s] is the time of the cooling.

T = 20 + (37 - 20) * exp(-0.000020357 * 10) + min(energy_lost, can_generate_player) / (80 * 3500) + active/passive heat gen + heating from armor - cooling from armor
energy lost = (36.995 - 37) * 280000 = 1400 J
can generate up to 1200 J 

heat capacity of armor is sum of components

dissapation = heat transfer coefficient * surface area * difference between temperatures
