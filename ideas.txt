mechanics
    energy - you need energy to function
    heat - each component generates heat, too much heat damages tools/armor and player

environmental effects
    heat - based on height (space - extreme cold, hell - extreme heat)
    medium rock layer - dangerous gases
    jungle - poisonous atmosphere
    ice biome - low temperatures
    underground ice biome - very low temperatures
    water - electrocution

PRE-HM

armor platings
    copper - high heat dissapation, low defense
    gold - medium heat dissapation, very low defense
    aluminium - medium heat dissapation, medium defense
    steel - low heat dissapation, very high defense
    iron - low heat dissapation, high defense,
    tungsten carbide - medium heat dissapation, extremely high defense
    diamond doped tungsten carbine - very high heat dissapation, extremely high defense

batteries
    nickel-iron - low energy storage
    lead-acid battery - medium energy storage (sulfur is obtained near lava lakes)
    lithium iron phosphate - high energy storage
