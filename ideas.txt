mechanics
    ✓ energy - you need energy to function
    heat - each component generates heat, too much heat damages tools/armor and player
    insulation - protects you from low/high heat

environmental effects
    ✓ heat - based on height (space - extreme cold, hell - extreme heat)
    ✓ desert/beach = high temperature
    medium rock layer - dangerous gases
    jungle - poisonous atmosphere
    ✓ ice biome - low temperatures
    underground ice biome - very low temperatures
    water - electrocution

insulation
    insulation protects against cold, prevents heat from escaping
